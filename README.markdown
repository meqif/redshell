redshell
========

redshell is a simple and light UNIX shell.

Suggestions and patches are very welcome.

Building
--------

To build it, you need SCons and Python installed. Just run `scons` and you're
done! There are no other dependencies.

Bugs
----

There certainly are some of them, hiding in the dark corners of the code when
you open the door. If you see one, shoot me an email with the GPS coordinates of
the bug or send me the remains of the bug you squashed.
